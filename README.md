# Graphx

This project is a simple fluent API to draw graph & interact with its data structure.
It includes a small example in file usage.js to interact with the fluent and build your own application.
It is based on <a href="https://graphology.github.io/" target="_blank">Graphology</a> to build data structure & <a href="https://www.sigmajs.org/" target="_blank">Sigma</a> to show layout and animations.
